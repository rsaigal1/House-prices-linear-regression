# House-prices-linear-regression
I'll work with housing data for the city of Ames, Iowa, United States from 2006 to 2010. You can read more about why the data was collected here(https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10691898.2011.11889627). You can also read about the different columns in the data here(https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/307/data_description.txt).  I will be running a linear regression pipeline in order to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa as accurately as possible.  This project Is also for practicing feature selection and feature engineering.
